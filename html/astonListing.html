                    <h2>Aston Martin DBS</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Aston Martin DBS is a grand tourer produced by the British 
                    manufacturer Aston Martin Lagonda Limited from 1967 to 1972.
                    From 2007 to 2012 the DBS name was resurrected for a new model,
                    the Aston Martin DBS V12. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The DBS was intended as the successor to the Aston Martin DB6,
                    although the two ran concurrently for three years. Powered by
                    a straight-six engine, it was produced from 1967 until 1972, eventually
                    being phased out in favour of the Aston Martin V8. It was a larger coup√©
                    than the DB6, with four full sized seats, but was powered by the same
                    4.0 L engine as the previous car. Claimed engine output was 280 bhp (209 kW; 284 PS)
                    , but a Vantage engine option used Italian made Weber carburettors,
                    increasing output to an advertised 325 bhp (242 kW; 330 PS). In 1966, Touring of Milan
                    was commissioned to design the DB6 replacement and produced two prototypes before the
                    design house went out of business. The DB6 was incapable of accommodating the planned
                    V8-engine and had to be replaced.[6] William Towns was then hastily brought in to
                    design the new car. The DBS was intended to have a more "modern" look than the previous
                    series of Aston models (the DB4 through DB6), and it incorporated a fastback style
                    rear end and squared off front grille, atypical of Astons at the time but very much
                    then in vogue in automotive design circles of the late sixties. Trademark Aston
                    design features, such as a bonnet scoop, knock-off wire wheels with 815X15 Crossplys
                    or 205VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN72 Radial Tyres, and side air vents with stainless steel
                    brightwork were however retained. The DBS was the last Aston Martin to be developed
                    under David Brown's control.
