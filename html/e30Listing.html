                    <h2>BMW e30 M3</h2>
                    <p>
                    The first BMW M3 was based on the E30 3 Series and was intended to be
                    a homologation special to satisfy the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft
                    and Group A Touring rules, which required a total of 5,000 cars to be built.
                     It was presented to the public at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, and began 
                     production from March 1986 to June 1991. The E30 M3 was mainly
                     produced in the coupé body style, but limited volumes of convertibles were also produced
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The front splitter, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body
                    in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the bootlid improved the aerodynamics.
                    For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window was flattened and the tailgate was made of
                    light, glass-reinforced plastic raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow.
                    The changes over the rear of the car resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line
                    stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in – not, as with the other E30 models,
                    framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low drag
                    coefficient of Cd=0.33 instead of Cd=0.38 as in the standard 3 Series. The only exterior
                    body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, and sunroof. 
                    The brake calipers, discs and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model. The transmission
                    was a Getrag 265 5-speed manual. European models were outfitted with a dogleg version with 
                    close ratios and a 1:1 ratio for fifth gear. North American models used a traditional shift
                    pattern and had wider gear spacing with an overdriven fifth gear.[10] A clutch-type limited-slip
                    differential was standard equipment.

                    <p>In 2004, Sports Car International named the E30 M3 number six on the list of Top Sports
                    Cars of the 1980s. In 2007, Automobile Magazine included the E30 M3 in their "5 greatest
                    drivers cars of all time" under their 25 Greatest Cars of All Time.
