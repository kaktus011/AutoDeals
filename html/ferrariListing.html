         <h2>Ferrari Testarossa</h2>
         <p>
            The Ferrari Testarossa (Type F110) is a 12-cylinder mid-engine
            sports car manufactured by Ferrari, which went into production
            in 1984 as the successor to the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer.
            The Pininfarina-designed car was originally produced from 1984
            until 1991, with two model revisions following the end of Testarossa
            production called the 512 TR and F512 M, which were produced from 1992
            until 1996. Including revised variations, almost 10,000 cars in total
            were produced, making it at the time one of the most mass-produced Ferrari models
         </p>

         <p>
            The Testarossa is a two-door coup√© that premiered at the 1984 Paris Auto Show.
            All versions of the Testarossa were available with a rear-mounted,
            five-speed manual transmission. The rear mid-engine design (engine between
            the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity in the middle of
            the car, which increases stability and improves the car's cornering ability,
            and thus results in a standing weight distribution of 40% front: 60% rear. The original
            Testarossa was re-engineered for the 1992 model year and was introduced as the 512 TR
            (TR meaning TestaRossa), at the Los Angeles Auto Show, effectively as a completely new
            car, and an improved weight distribution of 41% front, 59% rear. Another
            new variant called the F512 M was introduced at the 1994 Paris Auto Show.
            The car dropped the TR initials and added the M which in Italian stood
            for modificata, or translated to modified, and was the final version of
            the Testarossa, which continued its predecessor's weight distribution improvement
            of 42% front, 58% rear. The F512 M was Ferrari's last vehicle that featured the flat-12 engine.
            The Testarossa is a recognized cultural icon of the 1980s, and was popularized by media
            including the 1984 television series Miami Vice (from the 1986 season onward) and Sega's
            1986 video game Out Run.
